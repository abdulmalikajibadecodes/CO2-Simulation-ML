    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and simulating **CO‚ÇÇ storage** in the **Sleipner field**, one of the world's first and longest-running carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects located in the North Sea. The simulation tools enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3D visualization** of CO‚ÇÇ plume development across different geological layers\n",
    "- **Quantitative analysis** of plume volume, distribution, and migration patterns\n",
    "- **Velocity-based saturation modeling** from time-lapse seismic data\n",
    "- **Machine learning predictions** of future plume behavior and evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sleipner CO‚ÇÇ storage project**, operated by Equinor (formerly Statoil) in the Norwegian North Sea, began injecting CO‚ÇÇ in 1996. CO‚ÇÇ is captured from natural gas processing on the Sleipner platform and injected into the **Utsira Formation**, a saline aquifer approximately 1000 meters below the seabed. This pioneering project demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of industrial-scale CO‚ÇÇ storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geological structure of the Utsira Formation includes:\n",
    "- Nine sandstone layers (*L1-L9*)\n",
    "- Thin shale barriers between layers acting as partial flow barriers\n",
    "- A top seal (caprock) preventing upward migration of CO‚ÇÇ\n",
    "\n",
    "More than **20 million tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ** have been successfully stored at Sleipner, making it one of the most significant and well-documented CCS reference projects worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data & Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation uses data from the [CO2 Data Share consortium](https://co2datashare.org/), including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plume boundaries** - Outlines of CO‚ÇÇ presence in each layer derived from seismic monitoring\n",
    "- **Seismic data** - Pre-injection and post-injection velocity maps showing changes due to CO‚ÇÇ\n",
    "- **Well logs** - Data from wells 15/9-A-16 (injection well) and 15/9-13 (exploration well)\n",
    "- **Grid information** - Geological grid specifications for the simulation model (GRDECL format)\n",
    "- **Reference model** - Benchmark simulation model released by Equinor\n",
